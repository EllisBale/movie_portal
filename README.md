## **UX**


### Strategy

#### Project Purpose:

The projects purpose is to provide an immersive and user-friendly platform that allows users to explore and discover films with ease. The website enables users to book cinema tickets online, select seats and choose a film that is currently available. The website is designed to deliver the user a smooth experience across all devices and enhance accessibilty for cinema-goers.

#### User Goals:

#### Admin/Manager Goals:


#### Site Owner Goals

#### Target Audience 


#### Research

For this project, I looked at popular cinema websites such as Vue, Odeon and Cineworld. When looking at these websites I noticed a common trend in which all of the websites had a landing page with hero carousel images. They would include current movies showing in cinemas which would seem to grab a user's attention. It would benefit my website to have a carousel hero images on my landing page as it will show the user what the website is about. Most of the websites I visited had a dark theme to it to match the cinematic tone which makes it immersive. From this I will be using more dark tones for this project.


**Websites visited:**

[Vue](https://www.myvue.com/)

[Cineworld](https://www.cineworld.co.uk/#/)

[Odeon](https://www.odeon.co.uk/)

## Code Validation


### HTML


I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

| Directory | File | URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| static | [style.css](https://github.com/EllisBale/movie_portal/blob/main/static/css/style.css) |  [Link](https://movieportal-f2737f46bcb0.herokuapp.com/static/css/style.css) | ![screenshot](docs/testing_imgs/validations/css_validation.png) | There was no errors but there were 8 warnings. I didn't need to fix this because most of the warnings are coming from vendor extension and CSS variables not being statically checked.  |



### JavaScript


I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.

| Directory | File | URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| static | [script.js](https://github.com/EllisBale/movie_portal/blob/main/static/js/script.js) | [Link](https://movieportal-f2737f46bcb0.herokuapp.com/static/js/script.js)  | ![screenshot](docs/testing_imgs/validations/js_validation.png) | Delted an unused variable which I deleted. When using JShint, I needed to add `/* jshint esversion: 11 */` to the top of the file to allow ES11 syntax. |


### Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. Some warnings are outside of my control, and mobile results tend to be lower than desktop.

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

> [!NOTE]  
> I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### Python (Unit Testing)



I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality. In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

- `python3 manage.py test name-of-app`

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

- `pip3 install coverage`
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- `coverage run --omit="*/site-packages/*,*/migrations/*,*/__init__.py,env.py,.env" manage.py test`
- `coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

- `coverage html`
- `python3 -m http.server`

Below are the results from the full coverage report on my application that I've tested:

![screenshot](docs/testing_imgs/automation/coverage_1.png) ![screenshot](docs/testing_imgs/automation/coverage_2.png)

#### Unit Test Issues

**Description**

Ran into an issue with films_detail view because of Cloudinary.

**Steps to Reproduce**
`  def test_film_details_page(self):
        """
        Test that the film_details page returns 200 status code.
        """
        response = self.client.get(reverse('film_detail', args=[self.film_id]))
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'films_detail.html')`.

**Expected Behaviour**
The test responds with in the terminal "OK".

**Actual Behaviour**
`raise ValueError("Must supply cloud_name in tag or in configuration") ValueError: Must supply cloud_name in tag or in configuration.`
